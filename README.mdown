#Tinysong-cli

As you can imagine from the project name, Tinysong-cli is a command-line interface to query tinysong.com, written in Python. But it's not just that! Other than implementing the 3 way of searching for a song on tinysong (metasearch, limit search and the basic search), it adds the capability to search what is been playing on MPD or Cmus, find a match and tweet artist name, song name and the tinysong url to the song on Twitter. It's also possible to prepend or postpend (or both) a string to customize the tweet.

###Usage

Basically:

	tinysong-cli.py Queen who wants
	# => http://tinysong.com/J8YJ

	tinysong-cli.py -b Queen who wants
	# => Queen - Live at Wembley '86 (disc 1) - Who Wants To Live Forever # http://tinysong.com/J8YJ

	tinysong-cli.py -l 10 Queen
	# => Queen - Queen Gold - I Want to Break Free # http://tinysong.com/zTJr
	Queen - Greatest Hits - Don't Stop Me Now # http://tinysong.com/hyw2
	Queen - Queen Collection - Somebody to Love # http://tinysong.com/kraC
	Queen - Queen on Fire: Live at the Bowl (disc 2) - Under Pressure # http://tinysong.com/HTFq
	Queen - The Platinum Collection (disc 1: Greatest Hits I) - Killer Queen # http://tinysong.com/6Ygx
	Queen - Greatest Hits I & II (disc 1) - Bicycle Race # http://tinysong.com/7BSu
	Queen - Queen Ballads - Love of My Life # http://tinysong.com/7ftQ
	Queen - The 12" Collection - Radio Ga Ga # http://tinysong.com/zarO
	Queen - The Platinum Collection (disc 1: Greatest Hits I) - You're My Best Friend # http://tinysong.com/jPUs
	Queen - The Best I - Crazy Little Thing Called Love # http://tinysong.com/zG21

These are the basic ways to query tinysong.com. Adding a `-t` will tweet the first result. `-m` and `-c` stands for taking the current playing song on MPD or Cmus as query string for tinysong (they exclude each other and overwrite any other argument that may have been given on the command-line).  
For more informations, the usual `-h` will output the complete usage rules.

###Authentication

First of all, rename the provided file `tinysongconfig-default.py` in `tinysongconfig.py`.  
Then you'll need an API key from tinysong.com. Go there, ask for one and add it to the file in the format `APIKEY = 'your_api'` (it's a simple Python file).

If you want to tweet your query results from tinysong on Twitter, you'll need an access key and secret. Just run tinysong-cli.py with the `t` switch and follow the instructions (access key and secret will be written back to `tinysongconfig.py` so you won't need to re-authenticate next time). Oh, don't mess with the consumer keys will ya?
